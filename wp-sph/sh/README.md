# Shell Directory (Simulation Only)

This directory exists to simulate where malicious PHP shells are often stored when plugins are compromised.

**No real shell code is included in this repository.**

For educational or training purposes, you may optionally create harmless stub files like `example-shell.php` to test loading logic.

Never include or deploy real PHP shell scripts. Doing so may violate laws, terms of service, and GitHubâ€™s malware policies.
